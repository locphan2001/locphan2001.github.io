‚ù§Ô∏èThank you for visiting my personal page‚ù§Ô∏è

I am passionate about the field of operations research, particularly in exploring innovative approaches to address challenges in combinatorial optimization, such as quantum computing, where quantum computers serve as decision support systems, and machine learning, where neural networks play a similar role.

I enjoy studying the development of technological methods for tackling complex optimization problems and applying them to real-world scenarios, such as project management.
